"More money helps increasing performance, resiliency and reliability. Thus I chose bigger instances for EC2 and the database. In addition I changed the EC2 instances to be resizable on demand and to have a default scaling of 4 webservers and 4 applications to be open for future traffic spikes. To have a future proof system I as well went back to the 100gb storage within the database instances."
