"To reduce the cost I scaled down the database instances and decided to use RDS since smaller instances are allowed there. Furthermore I reduced the storage of the database since I saw in monitoring, that there is still some room left. As well the EC2 instances for the web server and hosting had to be scaled down to reach the cost budget."
